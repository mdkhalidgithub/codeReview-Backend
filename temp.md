```javascript
function sum(){return a+b;}
```

🔍 **Issues:**
* ❌ **Undefined Variables:** The variables `a` and `b` are used without being defined within the function's scope or
passed as arguments. This will result in a `ReferenceError` when the function is called.
* ❌ **Poor Function Signature:** A `sum` function typically expects the values it needs to sum as explicit parameters,
making it reusable and predictable. Relying on implicit global variables is a bad practice and makes the function
difficult to understand and maintain.

✅ **Recommended Fix:**

```javascript
/**
* Calculates the sum of two numbers.
* @param {number} a - The first number.
* @param {number} b - The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
*/
function sum(a, b) {
// Optional: Add input validation for robustness if non-numeric inputs are possible.
// if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
// console.error("sum() expects two numbers as input.");
// throw new TypeError("Inputs must be numbers.");
// }
return a + b;
}
```

💡 **Improvements:**
* ✔ **Clear Parameters:** The function now explicitly takes `a` and `b` as arguments, clearly defining its inputs and
making it reusable.
* ✔ **Predictable Behavior:** The function no longer relies on external, undefined global variables, preventing
`ReferenceError` and ensuring consistent behavior.
* ✔ **Enhanced Readability & Maintainability:** The function's purpose and expected inputs are immediately clear,
improving code readability.
* ✔ **JSDoc Documentation:** Added JSDoc comments to describe the function's purpose, parameters, and return value,
which is crucial for code documentation and tooling.
* 💡 **Robustness (Optional):** The commented-out section shows how to add type validation to ensure inputs are numbers,
which prevents unexpected behavior (like string concatenation if strings are passed) and makes the function more robust.
